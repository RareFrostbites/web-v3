- RFB Store UI is now here (still underconstruction)
- Fixed the logo on the top-left (homepage) when on large screen, now it's not shrinking for Firefox browsers
- Fixed the button where you'll redirect if you tap them, now it'll redirect you to the correct page
- We tweaked some of our system icons for consistent user experience
- We changed our fonts from TTF to WOFF2
